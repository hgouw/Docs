Let us now create a new Console Application using either SharpDevelop or Visual Studio.
After adding a reference to System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement, add the following statement near the top of your Program.cs file:
using System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement;

Next, remove any code in Main() and add a simple prompt for the username and password to authenticate against Active Directory:

// prompt for username
Console.Write("Username: ");
string username = Console.ReadLine();
// prompt for password
Console.Write("Password: ");
string password = Console.ReadLine();

For the authentication part, we can use a simple method described here.
After obtaining a reference to the domain using the PrincipalContext class (specifying the domain as a parameter), we simply use the ValidateCredentials() method to perform the authentication.
This gives us a boolean value indicating whether the authentication was successful or not.
// authenticate
using (PrincipalContext pc = new PrincipalContext(ContextType.Domain, "RANCH"))
{
    bool authenticated = pc.ValidateCredentials(username, password);
    if (authenticated)
        Console.WriteLine("Authenticated");
    else
        Console.WriteLine("Get lost.");
}

At this point, we need only add a simple statement to wait for user input before letting the application terminate:
Console.ReadLine();
